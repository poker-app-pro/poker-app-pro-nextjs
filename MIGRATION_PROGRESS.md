# Migration Progress to CLEAN Architecture

## Completed Migrations

### Facades (Framework-Agnostic Interfaces)

The following facade interfaces have been created to define the contract between the application and the infrastructure layers:

1. **ILeagueFacade** - Interface for league operations
2. **IPlayerFacade** - Interface for player operations
3. **IQualificationFacade** - Interface for qualification operations
4. **IResultsFacade** - Interface for tournament results operations
5. **ISeasonFacade** - Interface for season operations
6. **ISeriesFacade** - Interface for series operations
7. **IStandingsFacade** - Interface for standings operations

### Controllers (Framework-Specific Adapters)

The following Next.js controllers have been created to handle server actions:

1. **league.controller.ts** - Handles Next.js server actions for league operations
2. **player.controller.ts** - Handles Next.js server actions for player operations
3. **qualification.controller.ts** - Handles Next.js server actions for qualification operations
4. **results.controller.ts** - Handles Next.js server actions for tournament results operations
5. **season.controller.ts** - Handles Next.js server actions for season operations
6. **series.controller.ts** - Handles Next.js server actions for series operations
7. **standings.controller.ts** - Handles Next.js server actions for standings operations

### Server Actions (App Entry Points)

The following server action files have been migrated to use the CLEAN architecture:

1. **app/__actions/league.ts** - Now uses league.controller.ts
2. **app/__actions/players.ts** - Now uses player.controller.ts
3. **app/__actions/qualification.ts** - Now uses qualification.controller.ts
4. **app/__actions/results.ts** - Now uses results.controller.ts
5. **app/__actions/seasons.ts** - Now uses season.controller.ts
6. **app/__actions/series.ts** - Now uses series.controller.ts
7. **app/__actions/standings.ts** - Now uses standings.controller.ts

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Facade Implementations** - Create concrete implementations of the facade interfaces
2. **Set Up Dependency Injection** - Configure the DI container to inject the facade implementations into the controllers
3. **Migrate UI Components** - Update UI components to use the new server actions
4. **Add Unit Tests** - Add unit tests for the core application logic
5. **Add Integration Tests** - Add integration tests for the facade implementations
6. **Add E2E Tests** - Add end-to-end tests for the server actions

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear separation between application logic and framework-specific code
2. **Testability** - Easier to write unit tests for the core application logic
3. **Maintainability** - Easier to maintain and extend the codebase
4. **Flexibility** - Easier to switch to a different framework or infrastructure in the future
5. **Scalability** - Easier to scale the application as it grows
