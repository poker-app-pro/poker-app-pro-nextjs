# Clean Architecture Migration Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating code from outside the `src` directory into a clean onion architecture with maximum framework isolation.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Domain Layer Expansion âœ…
- **New Entities Created:**
  - `League` - Represents poker leagues
  - `Season` - Represents seasons within leagues
  - `Series` - Represents tournament series within seasons
  - `Tournament` - Represents individual tournaments
  - `Qualification` - Represents player qualifications for events
  - `Scoreboard` - Represents player standings in series

- **Value Objects Enhanced:**
  - Added `daysBetween()` method to `GameTime`
  - Added `subtract()` method to `Points`

- **Repository Interfaces Created:**
  - `ILeagueRepository`
  - `ISeasonRepository`
  - `ISeriesRepository`
  - `ITournamentRepository`
  - `IQualificationRepository`
  - `IScoreboardRepository`

### Phase 2: Application Layer Foundation âœ…
- **DTOs Created:**
  - `league.dto.ts` - Complete league data transfer objects
  - `season.dto.ts` - Complete season data transfer objects
  - `series.dto.ts` - Complete series data transfer objects
  - `tournament.dto.ts` - Complete tournament data transfer objects
  - `qualification.dto.ts` - Complete qualification data transfer objects
  - `scoreboard.dto.ts` - Complete scoreboard data transfer objects

### Phase 3: Framework Isolation Architecture âœ…
- **Application Facade Layer:**
  - Created `src/application-facade/` directory structure
  - `ILeagueFacade` interface for framework-agnostic league operations
  - `ISeriesFacade` interface for framework-agnostic series operations
  - `ITournamentFacade` interface for framework-agnostic tournament operations
  - `IQualificationFacade` interface for framework-agnostic qualification operations
  - `IScoreboardFacade` interface for framework-agnostic scoreboard operations

- **Presentation Layer with Framework Isolation:**
  - Created `src/presentation/adapters/nextjs/controllers/` structure
  - `league.controller.ts` - Next.js specific server actions that call facades
  - `series.controller.ts` - Next.js specific server actions for series

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### 1. Complete Framework Independence
- Core business logic has zero framework dependencies
- Domain entities contain pure business rules
- Repository interfaces define contracts without implementation details

### 2. Easy Framework Replacement
- Next.js code isolated to `src/presentation/adapters/nextjs/`
- To replace Next.js: Only change the adapter layer
- Core business logic remains untouched

### 3. Clean Data Flow
```
Next.js Controller â†’ Facade â†’ Application Service â†’ Domain Entity
```

### 4. Dependency Inversion
- Framework code depends on abstractions (facades)
- Core business logic defines interfaces
- Infrastructure implements interfaces

## Current Architecture Structure

## Next Steps (Remaining Work)

### Phase 4: Complete Application Layer
- [x] Create remaining DTOs (Series, Tournament, Qualification, Scoreboard)
- [ ] Create application services for all entities
- [ ] Migrate existing use cases to new structure

### Phase 5: Infrastructure Layer Expansion âœ…
- [x] Create Amplify repository implementations for new entities
- [x] Create authentication service
- [x] Expand DI container with new dependencies
- [x] Migrate `lib/amplify-utils.ts` into infrastructure

### Phase 6: Complete Application Facades
- [x] Create facade interfaces for all entities
- [ ] Implement all facade classes
- [ ] Wire facades to application services

### Phase 7: Complete Presentation Layer Migration
- [ ] Migrate all `app/__actions/` to Next.js controllers
- [ ] Migrate `components/` to React adapters
- [ ] Migrate `contexts/` to React adapters
- [ ] Migrate `middleware.ts` to Next.js adapters
- [ ] Migrate `lib/utils.ts` to web utilities

### Phase 8: Framework Replacement Preparation
- [ ] Create framework-agnostic view models
- [ ] Create data mappers between DTOs and view models
- [ ] Document framework replacement process

## Code Outside `src` Directory (To Be Migrated)

### High Priority (Business Logic)
- `app/__actions/` - Server actions (partially migrated)
- `contexts/` - React contexts with business logic
- `middleware.ts` - Authentication middleware

### Medium Priority (Presentation Logic)
- `components/` - React components
- `lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions

### Low Priority (Configuration)
- `amplify/` - AWS Amplify configuration
- Root configuration files

## Migration Strategy

### Current Approach: Bottom-Up
1. âœ… Domain entities and business rules
2. âœ… Repository interfaces
3. ðŸš§ Application services and facades
4. ðŸš§ Infrastructure implementations
5. ðŸš§ Presentation adapters

### Framework Isolation Validation
To test framework isolation, we should be able to:
1. Replace Next.js with SvelteKit by only changing `src/presentation/adapters/`
2. Replace React with Vue by only changing `src/presentation/adapters/react/`
3. Replace Amplify with another backend by only changing `src/infrastructure/`

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero framework imports in `src/core/`
- [ ] All business logic accessible through facades
- [ ] All external dependencies injected via interfaces
- [ ] Complete test coverage of domain layer
- [ ] Documentation for framework replacement process

## Notes
- The migration maintains backward compatibility
- Existing code continues to work during migration
- New features should use the clean architecture
- Framework-specific code is clearly isolated and marked
